'''Now instead of defining the function somewhere and calling it, we can use python's lambda functions, which are inline functions defined at the same place we use it.
So we don't need to declare a function somewhere and revisit the code just for a single time use.
They don't need to have a name, so they also called anonymous functions. We define a lambda function using the keyword lambda.'''

#  Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain 
# as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.

mylist = []
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)
print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
print(mylist[2]) # prints 3

# prints out 1,2,3
for x in mylist:
    print(x)

numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

# write your code here
numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)

strings.append("hello")
strings.append("world")

second_name = names[1]

# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)

# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
print([1,2,3] * 3)

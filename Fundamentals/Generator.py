'''Generators are used to create iterators, but with a different approach.Generators are simple functions which return an iterable set of items, one at a time, in a special way.
When an iteration over a set of item starts using the for statement, the generator is run.
 Once the generator's function code reaches a "yield" statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set.
 The generator function can generate as many values (possibly infinite) as it wants, yielding each one in its turn.'''
